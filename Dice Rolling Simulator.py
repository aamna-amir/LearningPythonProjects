# 4. Dice Rolling Simulator

# As the name of the program suggests, we will be imitating a rolling dice. 
# The program will generate a random number each dice the program runs, and the users can use the dice repeatedly for as long as he wants.  
# When the user rolls the dice, the program will generate a random number between 1 and 6 (as on a standard dice).
# The number will then be displayed to the user. 
# It will also ask users if they would like to roll the dice again. 
# The program should also include a function that can randomly grab a number within 1 to 6 and print it. 
# This beginner-level project will help build a strong foundation for fundamental programming concepts.
